**Question:** {question}

Break this question down:
1. What are the key sub-topics that need to be covered for a comprehensive answer?
2. What specific data points, facts, or perspectives should we look for?
3. What would a complete, high-quality answer include?

Return a JSON object with:
- "sub_questions": Array of 3-6 specific sub-questions to investigate
- "key_topics": Array of key topics/angles to cover
- "success_criteria": One sentence describing what a complete answer looks like

Example:
{
  "sub_questions": ["What is the cost of living in X?", "How is the healthcare system?"],
  "key_topics": ["economy", "healthcare", "safety", "culture"],
  "success_criteria": "A balanced comparison covering cost, quality of life, and practical considerations."

Generate {num_queries} focused search queries that will help answer the question.

**New findings from this round:**
{new_findings}

Integrate the new findings into the existing report. Produce an updated, well-organized \
report that answers the original question as completely as possible given all evidence so far. \
Remove redundancy, resolve contradictions, and maintain logical flow. \
Keep source URLs as inline citations where relevant.

Write only the updated report — no preamble or meta-commentary.

**Current report:**
{report}

**Rounds completed:** {round_num}

Based on the report so far, do we have enough information to answer the question \
comprehensively?  Consider:
- Are the key aspects of the question addressed?
- Are there obvious gaps or unanswered sub-questions?
- Is the evidence sufficient and from multiple sources?

Reply with ONLY "YES" or "NO" followed by a brief one-sentence reason.
Example: "YES — The report covers all major aspects with evidence from multiple sources."
Example: "NO — We still lack information about the economic impact."

**Question:** {question}

**All collected evidence and analysis:**
{report}

Requirements:
- Write at MINIMUM 1500 words — this should be a thorough, magazine-quality article
- Use clear ## headings and ### subheadings to organize into logical sections
- Each section should have multiple detailed paragraphs, not just bullet points
- Synthesize and analyze the information — explain WHY things matter, draw comparisons, provide context
- Include specific data points, numbers, and statistics from the evidence
- Include source URLs as inline citations [like this](url)
- Note where sources agree and where they disagree
- Add a brief executive summary at the top
- End with a clear conclusion that directly answers the question
- Write in an engaging, informative style — not dry or robotic

- For EACH product include: name as ### heading, approximate price, 2-3 sentence summary, **Pros:** bullet list, **Cons:** bullet list, **Where to buy:** URLs as links
- Start with a quick-compare markdown table of top picks (columns: Name, Price, Best For, Rating)
- End with a ## Verdict section picking Best Overall and Best Value
- Still include source citations inline`,

  comparison: `IMPORTANT FORMAT OVERRIDE — this is a COMPARISON report:
- Create a ## Comparison Table as a markdown table comparing ALL options across key criteria (rows = criteria, columns = options)
- Use checkmarks, ratings, or short values in cells
- Write a ## section per option with its strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use case
- End with ## Best For verdicts (e.g., "**Best for small teams:** Option A because...")
- Include a ## Shared Considerations section for things that apply to all options`,

  howto: `IMPORTANT FORMAT OVERRIDE — this is a HOW-TO guide:
- Start with ## Quick Guide — a super concise numbered list (one line per step, no details, just the action). Example: 1. Install X  2. Run Y  3. Configure Z
- Then ## Prerequisites listing what's needed before starting
- Then the detailed steps: ## Step 1: ..., ## Step 2: ...
- Each step should have a clear heading and detailed instructions
- Use blockquotes (> ) for tips and warnings: > **Tip:** ... or > **Warning:** ...
- End with ## Common Mistakes section
- Add estimated time and difficulty level near the top`,

  factcheck: `IMPORTANT FORMAT OVERRIDE — this is a FACT-CHECK report:
- Start with ## The Claim restating what's being checked
- Create ## Evidence For and ## Evidence Against sections
- Each piece of evidence should be a ### with source name, what it found, and how strong the evidence is
- Include a ## Verdict section with one of: **Supported**, **Mixed Evidence**, or **Unsupported**
- End with ## Nuance & Caveats for important context and limitations
- Be balanced and cite sources for every claim`,
